**Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am FrÃ©d, the Security Auditor!**

As a Security Auditor, I would like to see a number of principles and best practices built into the Supply Chain. 
The out-of-the-box Supply Chain we are using, provided with TAP for Julien's app, is already implementing best practices around security.

My main checkpoints are:
1. Auditing the source code CVE report
2. Making sure images that run in prod are signed
3. Making sure that the way to build/patch container image is consistent, repeatable and sustainable
4. Auditing the container image CVE report

So, off I got to check some of these guidelines. I have been given access to TAP UI here:

```dashboard:open-url
url: https://tap-gui.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/security-analysis
```

I can see Vulnerabilities displayed graphically by Severity. However, I have not applied any policy; hence none of the more severe CVEs violates these.

Click on the 'Does Not Violate Policy' menu and select the application for which I want to see the CVE report.  
I can finally see my CVE report and work with Julien and Chiara on fixing these before my production is harmed.
