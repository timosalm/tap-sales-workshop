Cool, I am progressing well so far!

I now want to see the details of my application. 
So I log into the TAP UI (User Interface) here:
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://tap-gui.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/catalog
```

**INSTRUCTIONS:** If you access the web portal for the first time, you'll have to select the Guest tile and press Enter.

I can see the TAP catalog with all the applications deployed, including my Inclusion application.
I can click on my Inclusion app and access pieces of information, such as:

1. **The Logical graph of the app** - all the services and their relationship.
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://tap-gui.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/catalog/default/system/emoji-world/diagram
```

3. **API Swagger definition** - the app API documentation.
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://tap-gui.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/catalog/dev-space/api/inclusion-{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/definition
```

4. **Runtime Resources** - to see application runtime resources such as application deployment objects and logs/metrics for monitoring and debugging. Here I can also find the application URL. 
As my application deploys further, I will be able to see more.
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://tap-gui.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/catalog/default/component/inclusion/workloads
```

Letâ€™s now look closely at the Supply Chain, the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) set of tools that come out of the box with the TAP installation.
