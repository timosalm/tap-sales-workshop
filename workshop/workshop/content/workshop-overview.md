# Tanzu Application Platform and VMware Application Catalog demo

In this workshop I will show you a combined TAP + VAC demo and talk your through the major business outcomes from a Developer perspective.
In order to make the workshop flow smoothly, I will start with deploying a SpringBoot application immediately so while TAP deploys it, we can look into key concepts of Tanzu Application Platform. 

So, as a Developer, I have developed an app with the help of TAP Accelerators that I will talk to you about in a minute and I now want to deploy my app in TAP by using this command:

```tanzu apps workload create -f /home/eduk8s/workload.yaml -y```
