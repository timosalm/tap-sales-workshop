As a customer, I love the idea that all TAP components are **OpenSource**. This allows me to avoid locking myself with a specific vendor. 

![TAP is built with an open source-first mindset!](../images/tap-open-source-first.png)

At this stage, as a Developer, I only have to worry about pushing my code to a code repository. My Platform & Security teams are in charge of configuring a TAP Supply Chain to deliver my application to production.

  
**Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Chiara, the TAP Platform Operator!**

I am responsible for deploying TAP and making its access easy for Developers. This includes building a Supply Chain to deliver code to production and give reassurance that all code in production has passed all the steps through an approved company-wide workflow. In order for me to make Developers productive, I need to be efficient; hence I would like to build Supply Chains that can be reused for other application deployments. 
Additionally, there are internal teams that only care about using TAP with optimised and configured out-of-the-box tooling and other teams that like freedom of choice when it comes to their own CI/CD tooling.

I have set the reusable out-of-the-box Supply Chain provided with TAP for Julien's app.  
This Supply Chain performs the following steps:  

1. **Gitops** - Monitoring code repository for changes
2. **Testing** - Testing application code
3. **Source Scanning** - Scanning application code 
4. **Build** - Buiding application as a container image
5. **Image Scanning** - Scanning the OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant container image
6. **Container Deployment** - Deploying the application into a Kubernetes cluster
7. **Return a URL** - Creating endpoints and exposing load balancers so the application can be accessed

Let's see these steps in the UI and check the progress.

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Click on the every box to see the Supply Chain steps as described earlier.

```dashboard:open-url
url: https://tap-gui.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}/supply-chain/host/{{ session_namespace }}/inclusion
```

Once the application is deployed, the application can be accessed here:
```dashboard:open-url
url: https://inclusion-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ENV_TAP_INGRESS }}
```
or alternatively, by clicking on Runtime Resources in TAP by filtering based on Link=inclusion.
