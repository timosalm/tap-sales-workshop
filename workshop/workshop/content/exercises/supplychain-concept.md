**Supply Chain Choreographer** is based on open source **Cartographer** and allows App Operators to create pre-approved paths to production by integrating Kubernetes resources with the elements of their existing toolchains, for example, Jenkins.

```dashboard:open-url
url: https://cartographer.sh
```

Each pre-approved supply chain creates a paved road to production. Orchestrating supply chain resources - test, build, scan, and deploy - allows developers to focus on delivering value to their users and provides App Operators the assurance that all code in production has passed through all the steps of an approved workflow.

##### Design and Philosophy

Cartographer allows users to define all of the steps that an application must go through to create an image and Kubernetes configuration. Users achieve this with the **Supply Chain** abstraction.

The supply chain consists of resources that are specified via **Templates**. Each template acts as a wrapper for existing Kubernetes resources and allows them to be used with Cartographer. 
There are currently four different types of templates that can be use in a Cartographer supply chain: Source Template, Image Template, Config Template, Deployment Template, and Generic Template.

The supply chain may also be **extended to include integrations to existing CI/CD pipelines** like Tekton by using the **Runnable CRD**.

While the supply chain is operator facing, Cartographer also provides an abstraction for developers called **Workloads**. Workloads allow developers to create application specifications such as the location of their repository, environment variables and service claims.

By design, **supply chains can be reused by many workloads**. This allows an operator to specify the steps in the path to production a single time, and for developers to specify their applications independently but for each to use the same path to production. The intent is that developers are able to focus on providing value for their users and can reach production quickly and easily, while providing peace of mind for app operators, who are ensured that each application has passed through the steps of the path to production that theyâ€™ve defined.
